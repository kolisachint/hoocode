## 0. Source pin and audit summary

### 0.1 Pinned source version

All porting work, parity fixtures and "done" criteria in this document refer to one
immutable hoocode snapshot:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| hoocode version | `0.6.0` (all four npm packages, lockstep) |
| hoocode commit | `2223437c99cc4279ad40a39d8ff9268a5c8ee0fd` |
| Commit date | 2026-10-01 |
| Previous pins | `0.5.89` `a6cd96e7` (2026-09-24 to 2026-10-01) |
| Machine-readable copy | `[workspace.metadata.hoocode.source]` (`hoocode-version`, `hoocode-commit`) in the root `Cargo.toml` |

**Pin policy.**

1. hoocode keeps shipping, so we don't chase `main`. Port from the pinned commit only:
   `git -C ../hoocode checkout 2223437c`.
2. Moving the pin is a deliberate PR. It updates `Cargo.toml` metadata and this header,
   and adds a "delta" checklist built from
   `git diff <old-pin>..<new-pin> -- packages/` (the files that changed, mapped to crates).
   `python3 migration/pin_drift.py delta <tag>` prints that checklist, and
   `pin_drift.py check` exits non-zero once upstream releases past the pin. Run it at the
   start of a session, and nightly in CI (`migration/ci/tui-parity.yml`), so drift is seen before users
   hit missing models or provider wire changes.
3. Golden fixtures (Phase 13) are recorded from the pinned commit and carry the pin in
   their file header. Fixtures from a different pin fail the check.
4. The previous revision of this plan targeted **0.4.146**. Everything marked done in
   Phases 0–6 was ported against 0.4.x, so it needs re-verification against 0.5.89
   (see §0.2).

### 0.2 Audit of the Phase 0–6 "complete" claim (2026-09-24)

`cargo test --workspace` is green (645 tests, 0 failures) and the crate skeleton is
sound. However, the earlier status documents (`MIGRATION_STATUS.md`,
`MIGRATION_COMPLETE*.md`) claim "100% / feature parity", and that does not hold. What
the audit found:

| # | Finding | Evidence | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Wire formats don't match hoocode.** `ai-types`/`agent-types` have no serde attributes, so messages serialize as `{"inner":{"Standard":{"User":{…}}}}` with snake_case fields. hoocode uses `{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text",…}]}`, camelCase. Session entries use `#[serde(rename_all)]` on the enum, which renames variants only, so fields come out as `parent_id` instead of `parentId`. | A probe that parses a real hoocode `message` session line fails with `missing field 'inner'`. | **Blocker.** Hoocode sessions can't be loaded, and the RPC and JSON print formats diverge. |
| A2 | **The app doesn't use most crates.** `hoocode-code-main` doesn't depend on `tui-*`, `code-session`, `agent-mcp`, `agent-compaction`, `code-subagents` or `code-extensions`. Interactive mode is a 90-line crossterm `readline` loop. | `crates/hoocode-code-main/Cargo.toml`, `runtime.rs::run_interactive_mode` | **Blocker** |
| A3 | **The whole stack is synchronous.** It uses `reqwest::blocking` and `std::sync::mpsc`, and only one crate depends on tokio. §7.4 said tokio. Streaming can't be cancelled mid-read, and steering, follow-ups, parallel tools and async-only libraries like `rmcp` all need an async core. | `grep reqwest crates/*/Cargo.toml` | High |
| A4 | **Tool set follows 0.4.x.** hoocode 0.5.89's default bundle is `read, bash, edit, write, SearchCodebase` plus opt-in `webfetch`, `websearch`, `todo`, `subagent`, `canvas` and plugin tools. It no longer ships `grep`/`find`/`ls`. The Rust tools are thin wrappers: no truncation, image reads, read dedup, process-group kill, edit-diff/fuzzy matching or mutation queue, and no `.gitignore` handling. | `packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools/index.ts` vs `crates/hoocode-code-tools/src/lib.rs` (940 LOC Rust vs ~8K LOC TS) | High |
| A5 | **Provider/API coverage is partial.** hoocode dispatches on 8 `Api`s and 31 known providers. Rust dispatches on a hard-coded provider name (`anthropic/openai/opencode/google`). `openai-responses`, `openai-codex-responses` and `google-gemini-cli` are missing, as is compat-driven routing for the ~25 OpenAI-compatible providers. `AssistantMessage` lacks `api/provider/model/responseId`, and `Model` lacks `compat`. Rust bundles 907 models against hoocode's 1224. | `crates/hoocode-code-main/src/runtime.rs::make_stream_fn`, `packages/ai/src/types.ts` | High |
| A6 | **Agent loop parity is untested.** `agent-core` and `agent-loop` have 0 tests. hoocode's `agent.test.ts`/`agent-loop.test.ts` are not ported. | `grep -c '#\[test\]'` | High |
| A7 | **The "parity test" only checks `--help`.** `scripts/parity_test.sh` checks that flags appear in the help text. It never runs hoocode and hoocode side by side. *(Resolved by 13.1–13.3.)* | `scripts/parity_test.sh` | Medium (process) |
| A8 | **Two parallel session stacks.** `agent-session` (`FileSessionStore`) and `code-session` (JSONL tree) overlap, and neither is wired into the CLI. | crate sources | Medium |
| A9 | **Four copies of an SSE parser, one per provider, plus a 1.8K-LOC hand-written MCP transport.** Maintained ecosystem crates (`eventsource-stream`, `rmcp`) already cover these. | `crates/*/src/sse.rs`, `agent-mcp/src/transport.rs` | Medium (maintenance) |

**Size check at the pin** (non-generated TypeScript `src/` LOC vs. Rust LOC today):

| Namespace | hoocode 0.5.89 | hoocode | Rough coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| tui | 13.9K | 14.6K (tui-*) | ~90%. Faithful port, but **not wired into the app** |
| ai | 14.1K (+22.2K generated models) | 9.2K | ~55% |
| agent | 9.2K | 5.0K | ~45% |
| coding-agent | 95.7K | 7.3K (code-*) | **~10%** |

**Conclusion.** The TUI namespace is the most complete. AI is roughly half done.
Agent and coding-agent are early. The honest overall figure is **about 25–30% of
pinned hoocode behavior**, not 100%. Phases 7–13 (§9) are the gap-closure plan.
Phase 7 (wire formats plus the async core) must land first, because every later
phase builds on those types.

> The following status files predated this audit and overstated completion:
> `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`, `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`, `MIGRATION_COMPLETE_FINAL.md`,
> `MIGRATION_FINAL_SESSION_SUMMARY.md`, `MIGRATION_SESSION_SUMMARY.md`,
> `MIGRATION_VIM_JUMP_COMPLETE.md`. **This document is the single source of truth.**
> Those files were removed in task 7.0, and their history is summarized in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### 0.3 Status at pause (2026-10-01)

By user decision, the migration is **paused** so that `hoocode` can be used. Every task
left in `migration/ledger.json` is `deferred` (9.1, 10.2e, 10.11, 13.4 and all of
phase 12), and none is `todo` or `in_progress`. Tally: phases 7, 8 and 11 complete; phase 9
at 6/7; phase 10 at 33/43 done plus 8 `l1_done`; phase 13 at 9/10. Check the current figures
with `python3 migration/ledger.py status`.

- **Usable now:** interactive TUI, print, json and rpc modes; every catalog provider and
  OAuth login; sessions (compaction, resume, fork, tree); the read, bash, edit, write,
  lexical SearchCodebase, TodoWrite and ask_options tools; the permission gate;
  ask/plan/build/debug modes; subagents; skills, prompt templates, context files, themes,
  settings and keybindings.
- **L1-only tasks** (10.2a/b/c/d/f/g, 10.4c, 10.5): they pass their ported tests, but their
  Level-2 scenarios use the default-bundle system prompt. At the pin, that prompt includes the
  SearchHooCode self-knowledge tool from 12.4, so the model requests differ in that one block.
- **Deferred:** MCP (9.1, 10.11), webfetch/websearch (10.2e; decision pending between the
  external `webtools` binary and in-process `htmd`/`dom_smoothie`), plugins (12.1),
  package manager (12.2), code extensions (12.3), semantic search (12.4), `/loop` and
  `/goal` (12.5), warm pool (12.6), and the 12.7 extras (HTML export, `/share`, `/learn`,
  canvas, teams, voice, telemetry, version check). 13.4 can close only once these tasks have
  ported their 94 pending TS test files.
- **Open decisions:** 9.1 (adopt `rmcp` and accept that tool results are re-serialized, or
  keep a hand-written transport) and 10.2e (see its ledger `block` entry).
- **Resuming:** move a task back to `todo` in the ledger (it is a user decision, so note it
  in the task log), then follow `.claude/skills/continue-migration/SKILL.md`.
- **2026-10-08:** added the `moved` status (closed, like `done`). Tasks 9.1, 10.2e, 10.11,
  12.1–12.7 and 13.4 are `moved` to their design cards (13.4 has none, so it stays here).

## 1. Scope and Goals

### What

Rewrite [HooCode](https://github.com/kolisachint/hoocode-ts) — a deterministic terminal coding agent written as a TypeScript npm monorepo (4 packages, ~133K hand-written LOC plus ~22K generated at the v0.5.89 pin) — into an **ultramodular Rust workspace** of ~47 small, independently versioned crates published on [crates.io](https://crates.io).

### Why

| Concern | TypeScript | Rust |
|---|---|---|
| Startup time | Node.js/bun runtime overhead (100–300 ms) | Near-instant (~1 ms) |
| Distribution | Requires Node.js; binary bundling fragile (`pkg`, `bun build --compile`) | Single static binary per platform via `cargo build` |
| Performance | GC pressure, large heap | Zero-cost abstractions, deterministic memory |
| Cross-platform | 3 targets via fragile tooling | Every platform natively via `rustc` target triples |
| Native tooling | Downloads fd/rg + JS fallback | Pure-Rust fallback via `grep`/`ignore`/`walkdir` crates |

### Non-Goals

- Full feature parity in initial release (tracked incrementally per Phase).
- Backward-compatible npm publishing (Rust crates replace npm packages).
- TypeScript extension/plugin system in v1 (WASM plugin system deferred).

---

## 2. Principles

Adapted from the [pycortex migration](https://github.com/kolisachint/pycortex) which follows the same architecture:

1. **Ultra-modular.** Each crate has one responsibility, minimal deps, its own tests, its own `Cargo.toml`. Stable leaves publish first.
2. **Stability-ordered.** Port in order of *lowest churn first* (measured from hoocode git history). Stable code lands on crates.io early; volatile code stays in-repo until settled.
3. **Never broken.** Every migration step ends with `cargo test --workspace` green. Steps are small, atomic, and independently revertable.
4. **Testable by construction.** Every ported module ships with tests ported from the TS originals. The `faux` provider makes the whole stack testable offline.
5. **Executable plan.** The migration plan (Phase sections below) is a machine-readable checklist tracked in this document.
6. **Automated releases.** GitHub Actions + crates.io token publish tagged crates. No manual uploads.
7. **Lockstep versioning.** All crates share one workspace-level version (semver). Version bumps happen atomically via `scripts/bump_versions.py`.
8. **Volatility isolation.** *(Added 2026-09-24.)* Code that churns upstream, or that tracks a fast-moving vendor API or third-party crate, lives in its own small crate behind hoocode-owned types (§5.5). A dependency firewall enforces this.
9. **Two-level done.** *(Added 2026-09-24.)* Programmatic tests **and** a rendered-TUI comparison against the pinned hoocode (§5.6).

## 3. Source Analysis — HooCode (TypeScript)

### 3.1 Package inventory

Four npm packages, lockstep-versioned at **0.5.89** (pinned, §0.1). The previous plan revision measured 0.4.146.

| Package | npm name | LOC (src) | TS test files | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/tui` | `@kolisachint/hoocode-tui` | ~13,900 | 36 | Terminal UI library: differential renderer, components, keybindings, mouse, frame |
| `packages/ai` | `@kolisachint/hoocode-ai` | ~36,300 (22.2K generated models) | 68 | Unified LLM API: 8 APIs, 31 known providers, streaming, OAuth (5 flows), images |
| `packages/agent` | `@kolisachint/hoocode-agent-core` | ~9,200 | 17 | Agent loop, agent harness, compaction + branch summarization, session repo, MCP (+OAuth), proxy |
| `packages/coding-agent` | `@kolisachint/hoocode-agent` | ~95,700 | 279 | The `hoocode` CLI: AgentSession, tools, settings, modes, extensions/plugins, subagents, interactive TUI |

#### 3.1.1 coding-agent feature inventory at the pin (for triage)

| Area | Main TS files (LOC) | Target phase |
|---|---|---|
| AgentSession orchestrator | `core/agent-session*.ts` (~4.3K) | 10.3 |
| Settings / config / auth | `core/settings-*.ts`, `config.ts`, `core/auth-storage.ts` (~2.9K) | 10.1, 10.4 |
| Model registry / resolver | `core/model-registry.ts`, `core/model-resolver.ts` (~1.5K) | 10.4 |
| Session manager (JSONL tree) | `core/session-manager.ts` (1.4K) | 7.2, 10.3 |
| Built-in tools | `core/tools/*` (~8K) | 10.2 |
| Resources: skills, prompt templates, context files, slash commands, modes | `core/{resource-loader,skills,prompt-templates,context-files,slash-commands,mode-prompts}.ts`, `extensions/core/modes.ts` (~3.7K) | 10.5 |
| Built-in core extension (permission gate, MCP loader, modes, cost, thinking escalation, ask-options) | `extensions/core/*` (~5K) | 10.6, 9.1, 10.5 |
| Print / RPC modes | `modes/print-mode.ts`, `modes/rpc/*` (~1.8K) | 10.8 |
| CLI args / main | `cli/*`, `main.ts` (~2.5K) | 10.7 |
| Subagents (pool, tool, lifeguard, depth, inbox, warm pool) | `core/subagent*.ts`, `core/lifeguard.ts`, `core/tools/subagent.ts` (~3.7K) | 10.9 (warm pool → 12) |
| Interactive TUI mode | `modes/interactive/**` (~20K incl. 45 components, theme 1.9K) | 11 |
| Extension runtime (TS, jiti) + plugin marketplace/packaging | `core/extensions/**`, `core/package-manager.ts` (~9K) | 12 |
| Semantic index / hybrid search / capability retrieval | `core/embsearch`, `core/search`, `core/capabilities` (~3K) | 10.2 (lexical), 12 (dense) |
| Scheduler/`/loop`, learn, canvas, teams, voice, export-html, telemetry | various (~10K) | 12 |

### 3.2 Dependency graph (build order = leaves first)

```
tui   (no internal deps)
ai    (no internal deps)
agent          → ai
coding-agent   → agent, ai, tui
```

### 3.3 Churn analysis → stability tiers

| Tier | Contents | crates.io posture |
|---|---|---|
| **T0 — frozen** | tui core (renderer, components, keys), ai types/stream, agent loop + types | Publish early, semver from day one |
| **T1 — settling** | ai providers (anthropic, openai, google), agent harness, MCP | Publish after tests ported |
| **T2 — volatile** | coding-agent `core/` (tools, session, settings, extensions) | In-repo only until stable |
| **T3 — hot / UI** | interactive mode, subagent pool, task panel | Port last |

**Migration order follows stability tiers AND dependency order:**  
`tui → ai → agent → code`

### 3.4 External dependency mapping (TypeScript → Rust)

Dependency lists come from the `package.json` files at the pin. **Status** says what the
workspace uses today. "Adopt" means switch to the named crate in the listed phase
rather than hand-writing or keeping a hand-written version.

| TS dep (pinned) | Rust crate (latest checked 2026-09-24) | Status today | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `typebox` (schemas + validation) | `serde` derive + **`jsonschema` 0.57** for tool-arg validation | serde only; no validation | Adopt `jsonschema` (8.5) |
| `partial-json` | **`partial-json-fixer` 0.5** | hand-rolled in `ai-util` | Adopt if it passes the ported `validation`/partial tests; keep ours otherwise (8.5) |
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `openai`, `@google/genai` | `reqwest` 0.12 (async, rustls) + **`eventsource-stream` 0.2** | `reqwest::blocking` + 4 hand-written `sse.rs` | Switch to async and share one SSE decoder (7.3) |
| `undici` | `reqwest` | ✓ | — |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP, OAuth) | **`rmcp` 3.4** (official SDK; `client`, `transport-child-process`, `transport-streamable-http-client`, `auth`) | 1.8K-LOC hand-written transport, no OAuth | Replace the transport with `rmcp`; keep our `mcp.json` loader and tool adapter (9.1) |
| `ignore` | **`ignore` 0.4** (ripgrep) | not used (`walkdir`, so `.gitignore` is ignored) | Adopt (10.2, 10.5) |
| `glob`, `minimatch` | **`globset` 0.4** (+ `ignore::overrides`) | `glob` | Adopt `globset` (10.2) |
| downloaded `rg`/`fd` + `native-search.ts` fallback | **`grep-searcher` + `grep-regex` + `ignore`** (ripgrep as a library) | naive regex over `walkdir` | Adopt: no binary downloads (10.2) |
| `diff` | **`similar` 3.x** (`TextDiff`, unified diff) | not used | Adopt for edit-diff and the diff component (10.2, 11.2) |
| `cli-highlight` | **`syntect` 5.3** + **`two-face`** (bat's syntax/theme set) | none | Adopt (11.2) |
| `marked` | `pulldown-cmark` | ✓ | — |
| `chalk`, `strip-ansi`, `get-east-asian-width` | own `tui-util` (ANSI-aware width/wrap) + `unicode-width` | ✓ (ported) | Keep. The semantics are tied to the renderer |
| `@silvia-odwyer/photon-node`, `file-type`, EXIF | **`image` 0.25** (resize, formats, EXIF orientation via `ImageDecoder::orientation`) + `infer` | none | Adopt (10.2 read-image, 11.4) |
| `@mariozechner/clipboard` | **`arboard` 3.6** (text + image) | none | Adopt (11.4) |
| `yaml` (frontmatter, agents, skills) | **`serde_yaml_ng` 0.10** (`serde_yaml` is unmaintained) | none | Adopt (10.5) |
| `uuid` | `uuid` (v7 for session ids, matching TS) | ✓ | — |
| `proper-lockfile` | **`fs4` 1.x** (advisory file locks) | none | Adopt for settings/auth/session writes (10.1) |
| atomic writes (`utils/atomic-file.ts`) | **`tempfile`** `NamedTempFile::persist` | none | Adopt (10.1) |
| `extract-zip`, `hosted-git-info` | `zip`, own parser | none | Phase 12 (package manager) |
| `jiti` (TS extensions) | none. Needs a redesign (§10.7) | `wasmtime` prototype | Phase 12 |
| `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (example extension) | none. Out of scope | — | — |
| CLI parsing (`cli/args.ts`) | `clap` 4 derive (rejected in 10.7a) | exact port of the hand-written parser | Keep own. The pinned grammar has multi-letter short aliases (`-nt`, `-nsc`), captures unknown `--flags` with a greedy value as extension flags, lets `-p` take the next arg as the prompt, and silently drops invalid values. `clap` would change observable behavior (10.7a) |
| OAuth PKCE + loopback server | keep own (`ai-oauth`) + **`open` 5** for browser launch | own + ad-hoc `open`/`xdg-open` | Adopt `open`; `oauth2` isn't worth it (provider quirks) |
| cron (`core/scheduler.ts`) | **`croner` 4** | none | Phase 12 |
| BM25 (capability retrieval) | **`bm25` 2.x** | none | Phase 12 |
| fs watch (`utils/fs-watch.ts`) | `notify` 8 (9 is still RC) | none | Phase 11/12 |
| process groups / kill tree (bash tool) | **`process-wrap` 10** (`ProcessGroup`/`JobObject`, tokio feature) | `std::process` with no group | Adopt (10.2) |
| HTML → text for `webfetch` | **`htmd`** (turndown port) + **`dom_smoothie`** (readability) | raw body | Adopt (10.2) |
| Biome + tsgo / vitest | `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test` (+ `insta` snapshots for fixtures) | ✓ | Add `insta` (13) |

#### 3.4.1 Reference implementations worth reading (not dependencies)

| Project | License | What to borrow |
|---|---|---|
| `openai/codex` → `codex-rs` | Apache-2.0 | tokio + crossterm TUI event-loop structure, inserting history above an inline viewport, `exec` process handling and sandboxing (Seatbelt/Landlock), `rmcp` client usage, apply-patch parser |
| `block/goose` | Apache-2.0 | `rmcp` integration and MCP OAuth wiring, provider abstraction over many OpenAI-compatible backends |
| ripgrep (`grep-*`, `ignore`) examples | MIT/Unlicense | `SearchCodebase` lexical retriever |

Borrow patterns, not wholesale code, and keep license headers for anything copied.

#### 3.4.2 Internal reuse (already in this workspace)

| Existing code | Reuse for |
|---|---|
| `tui-render`, `tui-components` (Editor, Markdown, SelectList, SettingsList, Loader, Image), `tui-keys`, `tui-terminal` (340 tests) | Phase 11 interactive mode. **Wire them in; don't rewrite on ratatui** (§7.4) |
| Responses-API request/stream logic inside `ai-provider-azure` | Extract into a shared `openai-responses` module for `openai-responses` and `openai-codex-responses` (8.3) |
| `code-session` JSONL tree (branching, labels, fork) | The single session implementation. Fold `agent-session` into it or reduce it to a trait (7.4) |
| `ai-oauth` (Anthropic PKCE, Copilot device flow) + `code-main::auth` callback server | Base for the Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity OAuth flows (8.4) |
| `agent-mcp::loader` (`mcp.json` parsing, tool naming) | Keep on top of `rmcp` (9.1) |
| `ai-provider-faux` | Deterministic driver for every parity fixture (13) |

## 4. Target Architecture — Multi-Level Modular Crate Structure

### 4.1 Naming convention

Following the **pycortex** model (which itself follows the hooocde model), each TypeScript package explodes into many small crates grouped by *co-change*. Crates share a **single lockstep version** defined at the workspace level.

**Naming pattern:** `hoocode-{namespace}-{leaf}`

| Namespace | Crate name pattern | Import namespace | PyPI equivalent (pycortex) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Top umbrella** | `hoocode` | `hoocode` | `hoocode` |
| **AI** | `hoocode-ai-*` | `hoocode::ai::*` | `hoocode-ai-*` |
| **Agent** | `hoocode-agent-*` | `hoocode::agent::*` | `hoocode-agent-*` |
| **Code** | `hoocode-code-*` | `hoocode::code::*` | `hoocode-cli-*` |
| **TUI** | `hoocode-tui-*` | `hoocode::tui::*` | `hoocode-tui-*` |

### 4.2 Crate types

| Type | Example | Contains code? | `publish` metadata | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Top umbrella** | `hoocode` | No (re-exports only) | `true` | Single `hoocode = "X.Y.Z"` dependency for users |
| **Namespace umbrella** | `hoocode-ai` | No (re-exports sub-crates) | `true` | Allows `hoocode-ai = "X.Y.Z"` to install full namespace |
| **Leaf** | `hoocode-ai-types` | Yes | `true` (when stable) | Single responsibility, independently testable |
| **Leaf (draft)** | `hoocode-code-tools` | Yes | `false` | In development, not yet ready for publication |

Umbrella crates carry `[package.metadata.hoocode] publish = true` but have **zero code** — they depend on all their namespace's leaf crates and re-export them. This means `cargo add hoocode-ai` installs every AI leaf.

### 4.5 Leaf `Cargo.toml` pattern

Every leaf follows a standard template:

```toml
[package]
name = "hoocode-ai-types"
version.workspace = true
authors.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
rust-version.workspace = true
description = "Core types for the hoocode AI namespace"
readme = "README.md"

[package.metadata.hoocode]
publish = true

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
```

The `[package.metadata.hoocode] publish = true|false` flag controls whether `publish_packages.py` includes this crate in automated releases. Umbrella crates and stable leaves are `true`; volatile leaves are `false` until they reach stability.

### 4.6 Umbrella crate pattern

```toml
[package]
name = "hoocode-ai"
version.workspace = true
# ... standard fields ...
description = "Umbrella crate for the hoocode AI namespace"

[package.metadata.hoocode]
publish = true

[dependencies]
hoocode-ai-types = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-stream = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-models = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-env = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-util = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-oauth = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-images = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-provider-anthropic = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-provider-openai = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-provider-google = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-provider-azure = { workspace = true }
hoocode-ai-provider-faux = { workspace = true }
```

The umbrella `lib.rs` re-exports all leaf crates:

```rust
//! Umbrella crate for the hoocode AI namespace.
pub use hoocode_ai_types as types;
pub use hoocode_ai_stream as stream;
pub use hoocode_ai_models as models;
// ...
```

This allows `use hoocode_ai::types::*` without specifying the leaf crate directly.

### 5.5 Revised split (2026-09-24): churn-driven crates, volatility tiers, dependency firewall

> Supersedes the §5.3 code-namespace table and extends §5.1/§5.2. The TS package
> `coding-agent` (95.7K LOC) is too big and changes too unevenly for ~10 crates.
> Crates are now cut so that **code which changes often, or which follows a
> fast-moving upstream (vendor APIs, OAuth flows, model lists, volatile third-party
> crates), lives in its own small crate**. Tracking an upstream change then touches
> one crate.

**Churn data** (commits touching the file, full hoocode history to the pin, 1,481
commits). Recompute when moving the pin:
`git log --name-only --format= -- packages/*/src | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`.

| Area (TS) | Commits | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| `modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts` | 118 | H |
| `core/settings-{manager,types,defaults}.ts` | 139 | V |
| `main.ts` + `cli/args.ts` | 117 | V |
| `core/tools/subagent.ts` + `core/subagent-pool.ts` | 100 | V |
| `core/agent-session.ts` (+ `-services`) | 56 | V |
| `extensions/core/hoo-core.ts` + `core/extensions/**` | 190 | D |
| `core/search/**`, `core/embsearch/**` | 92 | V / D |
| `modes/interactive/{components,theme}` | ~390 | H |
| `core/tools/{read,edit,write,bash}` | ~40 | S |
| `core/session-manager.ts`, `auth-storage.ts`, `config.ts` paths | low | S |
| `packages/tui` | 114 across 27 files (~4 each) | S |
| `packages/ai/src/providers/*` | 69 | V, driven by vendor APIs |

**Tiers.** **S**table: port once, rarely touched. **V**olatile: isolated leaf crates
with a narrow API. **H**ot UI: the thinnest possible orchestration crates over stable
widget crates. **D**eferred: Phase 12, created only on a go decision.

#### Code namespace target map

| Crate | Tier | Owns (TS at pin) | Ledger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code-paths` | S | `config.ts` dirs, env overrides, `.hoocode` fallback | 10.1 |
| `code-settings` | V | `settings-{types,defaults,manager,storage}.ts`. Typed schema plus unknown-key passthrough, so new upstream keys don't break us | 10.1 |
| `code-session` *(exists)* | S | `session-manager.ts` JSONL tree | 7.2 |
| `code-auth` | S | `auth-storage.ts`, `auth-guidance.ts` | 10.4b |
| `code-models` | V | `model-registry.ts` (`models.json`), `model-resolver.ts` | 10.4a/b |
| `code-tool-api` | S | tool definition wrapper, truncation, path utils, output accumulator, TodoWrite, ask_options | 10.2a/f |
| `code-tools-fs` | S | `read`, `write`, `edit` + `edit-diff`, read-dedup, mutation queue | 10.2a/c |
| `code-tool-bash` | S | `bash`, bash-executor, shell resolution | 10.2b |
| `code-tool-search` | V | `SearchCodebase` (lexical; ripgrep libs) | 10.2d |
| `code-tool-web` | V | `webfetch`, `websearch` (they follow external sites and services) | 10.2e |
| `code-prompts` *(exists)* | V | `system-prompt.ts` | 10.4c |
| `code-modes` | V | ask/plan/build/debug, mode prompts | 10.5b |
| `code-resources` *(exists)* | V | resource-loader, skills, prompt templates, context files, slash commands, agents | 10.5 |
| `code-permissions` | V | permission gate policy | 10.6 |
| `code-mcp` | V | MCP server discovery, deferred MCP, status (over `agent-mcp`) | 10.11 |
| `code-agent-session` | V | AgentSession orchestrator (+ runtime, services, retry, stats, tree nav) | 10.3 |
| `code-subagents` *(exists)* | V | pool, Task/TaskOutput, lifeguard, depth | 10.9 |
| `code-print` *(exists)* | S | print + json mode | 10.8a/b |
| `code-rpc` *(exists, rewrite)* | S | hoocode RPC protocol + client | 10.8c |
| `code-cli` | V | `cli/args.ts`, `main.ts` composition | 10.7a/b |
| `code-media` | V | image resize and convert, clipboard images (`image` crate) | 10.2a (sniff + resize for `read`), 11.4 |
| `code-tui-theme` | H | `theme.ts` + JSON themes | 11.1 |
| `code-tui-keybindings` | H | app keybindings | 11.1 |
| `code-tui-widgets` | H | message, tool, diff, footer, summary and task-panel components | 11.2, 11.5 |
| `code-tui-selectors` | H | model, session, tree, settings, theme, login selectors | 11.3 |
| `code-tui-app` | H | `interactive-mode.ts`, command executor (orchestration only) | 11.1–11.4 |
| `code-main` *(exists)* | S | the `hoocode` bin: calls `code-cli` and nothing else | 10.7a |
| `code-config` *(retired)* | — | deleted by 10.1c; its invented `config.json` and `migrate.rs` are replaced by code-settings' `.hoocode` read fallback | 10.1 |
| `code-tools` *(exists)* | — | retired by 10.2 (re-exports during transition) | 10.2 |
| `code-plugins`, `code-packages`, `code-extensions`, `code-capabilities`, `code-scheduler`, `code-extras` | D | Phase 12 | 12.x |

#### AI / agent / TUI additions (volatility isolation)

| Crate | Why separate | Ledger |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-models-catalog` | Generated model data changes every pin bump. `ai-models` keeps the logic | 8.1 |
| `ai-sse` | One SSE decoder (`eventsource-stream`) shared by all providers | 7.3 |
| `ai-provider-openai-responses` | Responses API shared by openai, azure and codex | 8.3 |
| `ai-provider-openai-codex`, `ai-provider-google-gemini-cli` | Subscription backends change independently | 8.4a/c |
| `ai-oauth` → core + `ai-oauth-{anthropic,github-copilot,openai-codex,google}` | Each vendor's OAuth flow changes on its own schedule | 8.7, 8.4 |
| `tui-highlight` | `syntect`/`two-face` behind our own API | 11.2 |

#### Dependency firewall

Each volatile third-party crate (fast-moving major versions, or a wrapper around a
vendor service) may be a dependency of **only its adapter crate(s)**, which expose
hoocode-owned types. The list is in `migration/dep-firewall.json`, and
`migration/check_dep_firewall.py` enforces it in CI and in `ledger.py verify`. Current
exceptions are listed under `pending` with the ledger task that removes them. Examples:
`rmcp` → `agent-mcp`, `wasmtime` → `code-extensions`,
`crossterm` → `tui-terminal`, `syntect` → `tui-highlight`, `grep-*` → `code-tool-search`.

### 5.6 Migration operations: ledger, two-level done, resuming

- **`migration/ledger.json`** is the machine-readable task list and the single source
  of truth for status. Phase 9 of this document is the narrative, and its checkboxes
  follow the ledger. `python3 migration/ledger.py status|next|show|start|verify`.
- **Level 1 (programmatic):** `cargo fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` and tests for the
  task's crates (with ported TS tests), plus the dependency firewall and task-specific
  commands.
- **Level 2 (rendered TUI):** `migration/tui-parity/harness.py` runs the *real* pinned
  hoocode (built by `setup_hoocode.sh` into `target/hoocode-pin`) and the *real*
  `hoocode` in identical fixed-size tmux terminals. It uses throwaway HOME and workspace
  directories and one scripted mock LLM (`mockllm.py`, OpenAI-compatible SSE, reached via
  a `models.json` custom provider). It sends identical keystrokes and captures the
  rendered screen as a (char, style) cell grid. After minimal normalization (temp
  paths, random session names, durations, branding) it requires identical **text**,
  identical **style** (colors and attributes), and optionally identical **model
  requests**, meaning the system prompt, tool schemas and tool results the model saw.
  Reports: `target/tui-parity/<scenario>/report.{md,html,png}`.
- A scenario is only trusted after `harness.py selfcheck` shows that hoocode renders it
  identically twice.
- **Done** = `ledger.py verify` passes both levels. L1 alone gives `l1_done`, and the
  task is re-verified once the tasks its scenarios need have landed.
- **Resuming:** "continue migration" follows `.claude/skills/continue-migration/SKILL.md`:
  orient (`ledger.py next`, `migration/PROGRESS.md`), port one task, gate, commit, write
  the handoff note, repeat.

Build order (leaves-first, matching `cargo build` topological sort):

1. `hoocode-ai-types`, `hoocode-tui-util` (no internal deps)
2. `hoocode-ai-*` leaves, `hoocode-tui-*` leaves
3. `hoocode-ai` umbrella, `hoocode-tui` umbrella
4. `hoocode-agent-types`, `hoocode-agent-core`, `hoocode-agent-loop`
5. `hoocode-agent-*` leaves
6. `hoocode-agent` umbrella
7. `hoocode-code-*` leaves
8. `hoocode-code` umbrella
9. `hoocode` top umbrella

This is exactly the order `cargo build --workspace` resolves automatically.

## 7. Key Migration Decisions: TypeScript → Rust

### 7.1 Language feature mapping

| TypeScript Feature | Rust Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Dynamic imports (lazy provider registration) | `once_cell::sync::OnceCell<HashMap<&'static str, Box<dyn ProviderFactory>>>` |
| Async/await | `tokio::async` — same semantics, compiler-enforced |
| `npm publish` | `cargo publish` |
| `package.json` `exports` map | Cargo features + `lib.rs` module visibility |
| `biome` (lint + format) | `cargo clippy` + `cargo fmt` |
| `vitest` | `cargo test` (built-in harness) |
| `undici` (HTTP) | `reqwest` + `tower` |
| `chalk` (colors) | `colored` or `termcolor` or `ratatui` styling |
| `yaml` | `serde_yaml` |
| `ignore` (gitignore) | `ignore` crate (Rust-native port) |
| `uuid` | `uuid` crate |
| `marked` | `pulldown-cmark` or `comrak` |
| `diff` | `similar` crate |
| `typebox` (runtime types) | `serde` + derive (compile-time only) |
| Dynamic TypeScript extensions | WASM plugins via `wasmtime` (deferred) |

### 7.2 LLM Provider implementation pattern

TypeScript exports a `stream()` function returning an async generator of events. Rust uses a trait-based approach:

```rust
// hoocode-ai-stream ports utils/event-stream.ts: EventStream<T, R> is a
// futures::Stream plus a final-result future; clones share one queue.
pub type AssistantMessageEventStream = EventStream<AssistantMessageEvent, AssistantMessage>;

// Each provider crate exports a stream() function that returns at once and
// runs the HTTP work on tokio (spawn_producer):
pub fn stream(
    model: Model,
    context: Context,
    options: SimpleStreamOptions, // options.signal: AbortSignal (CancellationToken)
) -> Result<AssistantMessageEventStream, BoxError>;
```

Provider registration is lazy (via `OnceCell`), mirroring `register-builtins.ts`:

```rust
static PROVIDER_REGISTRY: Lazy<Mutex<HashMap<String, Box<dyn ProviderFactory>>>> = Lazy::new(|| {
    let mut m = HashMap::new();
    m.insert("anthropic".into(), Box::new(AnthropicProvider));
    // ...
    Mutex::new(m)
});
```

### 7.3 Dynamic vs static dispatch

| Area | TypeScript | Rust |
|---|---|---|
| Provider registry | `register-builtins.ts` — lazy static imports | `HashMap<&'static str, Box<dyn ProviderFactory>>` via `OnceCell` |
| Tool registry | `TOOL_FACTORIES` table in `tools/index.ts` | `HashMap<&'static str, Box<dyn ToolFactory>>` |
| MCP tools | Dynamic shape, `Record<string, unknown>` | `dyn Tool` trait, `Box<dyn Any>` for unknown shapes |
| Agent loop callbacks | Callback functions in `AgentOptions` | `Box<dyn Fn(...)>` in `AgentLoopConfig` |

### 7.4 Key implementation decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| TUI framework | **Ported hoocode renderer** (`tui-render` + `tui-components`) on `crossterm`. *Revised 2026-09-24: was `ratatui`* | hoocode's renderer draws inline into scrollback with differential line updates, which is not ratatui's full-frame buffer model. The port already exists with 340 tests, so switching to ratatui would mean a rewrite plus behavior drift. Use codex-rs as the reference for tokio/crossterm event-loop integration only |
| Native search (fd/rg) | **ripgrep as a library** (`grep-searcher`, `grep-regex`, `ignore`, `globset`) | No binary downloads, `.gitignore`-aware, same engine as `rg` |
| Async runtime | **`tokio`** (multi-threaded) end to end: providers, agent loop, tools, MCP. *Status: providers, agent loop/core and OAuth are async since 7.3 (2026-09-25); tools still run their sync bodies on the blocking pool (7.5, 10.2)* | Needed for abort (`CancellationToken`), steering/follow-up queues, parallel tool execution, streaming TUI and `rmcp` (tokio-only). Library crates stay runtime-agnostic where practical (futures `Stream`) |
| Wire formats | **Byte-compatible with hoocode JSON** (messages, session JSONL v3, RPC protocol, `--mode json` events, `settings.json`, `auth.json`, `models.json`). *Added 2026-09-24* | Users can resume hoocode sessions, RPC clients and IDE integrations keep working, and golden fixtures from hoocode can be replayed |
| Config directory | Read `~/.hoocode/` and `.hoocode/` (project) as a fallback source. Write `~/.cortexcode/` and `.cortexcode/` | Matches §10.6. Project-level `.hoocode/` (modes, skills, prompts) must be discovered too, not only the global `settings.json` |
| MSRV | **1.88** (was 1.78) | Needed by `rmcp` 3.x. `similar` 3.x needs 1.85 |
| Serialization | **`serde`** + `serde_json` (`preserve_order`, so re-serialized JSON such as tool-call arguments keeps hoocode's key order) + `serde_yaml` | De facto Rust standard |
| HTTP client | **`reqwest`** | TLS, streaming, proxy support built in |
| Embedded templates | **`include_str!`** at compile time | No `build.rs` needed for static content |
| Generated models | **`build.rs`** (gated behind `CORTEX_UPDATE_MODELS=1`) | Mirrors TS `scripts/generate-models.ts` |
| Plugin system | **Split** (revised). Declarative plugins (`.agents-plugin` manifests: skills, commands, prompts, MCP servers) are ported in Phase 12. Code extensions run as an out-of-process JSON-RPC protocol, with the `wasmtime` prototype optional | hoocode's marketplace plugins are mostly markdown and JSON, so they port without executing TS. Only `ExtensionAPI` code hooks need a runtime |
| Binary name | **`hoocode`** | Short, memorable, available |
| Cross-compilation | **GitHub Actions matrix** — 4 targets | Native `rustc` cross-compilation |

## 8. CI / CD Pipeline

### 8.1 CI Workflow

**GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - name: cargo fmt
        run: cargo fmt --all -- --check
      - name: cargo clippy
        run: cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
      - name: cargo check
        run: cargo check --workspace
      - name: cargo test
        run: cargo test --workspace
      - name: cargo doc
        run: cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
```

**Triggered on:** push/PR to `main`.  
**Steps:** `fmt` → `clippy` → `check` → `test` → `doc`.  
**Concurrency:** automatic (no explicit concurrency needed since there's no per-package matrix yet — all crates build together via workspace).

**Comparison with pycortex CI:**

| Step | hoocode (Rust) | pycortex (Python) |
|---|---|---|
| Toolchain setup | `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` | `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5` (3.11) |
| Dep install | implicit via `cargo check` | `uv sync --all-packages` |
| Lint | `cargo clippy` | `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` |
| Type check | `cargo check` (compiler) | `pyright` |
| Test | `cargo test --workspace` | `pytest` per-package matrix |
| Doc build | `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` | (not available) |

**Future enhancement:** Add a per-namespace test matrix (similar to pycortex's `matrix: [tui, ai, agent, code]`) once the workspace has substantial code in all four namespaces.

### 8.2 PR Merge-Release Workflow

**GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/merge-release.yml`

```yaml

          done
          echo "level=$level" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

  release:

    uses: ./.github/workflows/release.yml
    with:
      level: ${{ needs.level.outputs.level }}
    secrets: inherit
```

**Labels:** `rust:patch` · `rust:minor` · `rust:major`

**Comparison with pycortex labels:** `rust:*` in hoocode ↔ `pypi:*` in pycortex ↔ `npm:*` in hoocode.

### 8.3 Manual Release Workflow

        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Pipeline steps:**

1. **Gates** — run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`; fail on any warning/error.
2. **Bump** — `scripts/bump_versions.py` rewrites workspace `version = "X.Y.Z"` in root `Cargo.toml`. All crates inherit via `version.workspace = true`.
3. **Commit + tag + push** — `git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`, `git tag vX.Y.Z`, `git push`.
4. **Publish** — `scripts/publish_packages.py` publishes every crate with `[package.metadata.hoocode] publish = true` in dependency order (leaves first). Skips versions already on crates.io (idempotent).
5. **GitHub Release** — `gh release create` with auto-generated release notes.

### 8.4 Cargo Publish

#### 8.4.1 Publishing Order

Crates are published in topological dependency order (leaves first, umbrellas last). This is enforced by `scripts/publish_packages.py`:

```
1. hoocode-ai-types         (no workspace deps)
2. hoocode-ai-stream        (depends on ai-types)
3. hoocode-ai-models        (depends on ai-types)
4. hoocode-ai-env           (no workspace deps)
5. hoocode-ai-util          (no workspace deps)
6. hoocode-ai-provider-faux (depends on stream, types, models)
   ... (other providers)
7. hoocode-ai-oauth         (depends on types)
8. hoocode-ai-images        (depends on types)
9. hoocode-ai               (umbrella — depends on all AI leaves)
10. hoocode-tui-util        (no workspace deps)
11. hoocode-tui-fuzzy       (no workspace deps)
12. hoocode-tui-keys        (no workspace deps)
13. hoocode-tui-terminal    (no workspace deps)
14. hoocode-tui-render      (depends on util, terminal)
15. hoocode-tui-editing     (depends on render, keys)
16. hoocode-tui-components  (depends on editing, fuzzy, keys)
17. hoocode-tui-images      (depends on components)
18. hoocode-tui             (umbrella — depends on all TUI leaves)
19. hoocode-agent-types     (depends on ai-types)
20. hoocode-agent-core      (depends on agent-types, ai-types)
21. hoocode-agent-loop      (depends on agent-types)
    ... (remaining agent leaves)
22. hoocode-agent           (umbrella)
    ... (code leaves — published later, once stable)
23. hoocode-code            (umbrella)
24. hoocode                 (top umbrella — depends on all namespace umbrellas)
```

#### 8.4.2 Lockstep Versioning

All crates share the **same version** defined in the workspace `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "0.0.1"
```

Each leaf inherits it via `version.workspace = true`. Bumping is a single operation:

```bash
python3 scripts/bump_versions.py patch  # 0.0.1 → 0.0.2
python3 scripts/bump_versions.py minor  # 0.0.1 → 0.1.0
python3 scripts/bump_versions.py major  # 0.0.1 → 1.0.0
```

#### 8.4.3 `scripts/bump_versions.py`

Scans the workspace `Cargo.toml`, finds the single `version = "..."` field in the `[workspace.package]` section, and replaces it with the bumped version. All member crates that use `version.workspace = true` automatically pick up the new value. No per-crate edits needed.

**Key difference from pycortex:** The Rust version is simpler because member crates inherit the workspace version rather than each carrying its own `version = "..."` line. pycortex's `bump_versions.py` must edit every `pyproject.toml` individually and re-pin sibling dependency ranges.

#### 8.4.4 `scripts/publish_packages.py`

Follows the same pattern as pycortex's `publish_packages.py`:

1. Parse all `crates/*/Cargo.toml`.
2. Resolve the dependency graph to determine topological order.
3. Check crates.io for each crate's name+version (skip if already published — idempotent).
4. Run `cargo publish -p <crate>` in topological order.
5. Apply rate-limiting delays between publishes (crates.io throttles new project creation).
6. Retry on 429 errors with `Retry-After` backoff.

#### 8.4.5 Crate publishability gate

A crate is only published to crates.io when:

1. All migration steps for its namespace phase are checked off.
2. Test coverage of ported modules ≥ the TS originals' test surface.
3. `cargo clippy` passes with `-D warnings`.
4. Its public API is documented.

**Control flag:** `[package.metadata.hoocode] publish = true|false` in each crate's `Cargo.toml`. Volatile crates are `false` until they reach publishable status.

#### 8.4.6 Crate name reservation

The one-off `.github/workflows/reserve-names.yml` workflow publishes `0.0.1` placeholder crates for all 47 workspace members to reserve names on crates.io. Safe to re-run: already-published versions are skipped.

## 9. Migration Plan

> **Reading Phases 0–6 after the 2026-09-24 audit.** Their checkboxes mean "a crate with
> this responsibility exists and has unit tests against hoocode **0.4.x**". They do
> **not** mean parity with the pinned 0.5.89 source, and they don't mean the crate is
> wired into the `hoocode` binary. Each ⚠ note says which later task reopens the item.
> New work is tracked in Phases 7–13.
>
> **Definition of done (from Phase 7 on).** A task is checked only when all four hold:
> (a) it is ported from the pinned commit, (b) the relevant TS tests are ported or have a
> documented equivalent, (c) it is reachable from the `hoocode` binary where it applies,
> and (d) a golden fixture covers its wire format when it has one (Phase 13).

### Phase 0 — Workspace bootstrap (✓ Complete)

- [x] **0.1 Root workspace** — `Cargo.toml` with all 47+ members, shared `[workspace.package]`
- [x] **0.2 CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fmt + clippy + check + test + doc
- [x] **0.3 Reserve crates.io names** — `.github/workflows/reserve-names.yml` publishes 0.0.1 placeholders
- [x] **0.4 Release plumbing** — `scripts/bump_versions.py`, `scripts/publish_packages.py`, `release.yml`, `merge-release.yml`
- [x] **0.5 Crate scaffolding** — All 47 crate directories with `Cargo.toml` and placeholder `lib.rs`
- [x] **0.6 Core types** — `hoocode-ai-types` (full types implementation), `hoocode-agent-types` (full types + Agent struct)

### Phase 1 — AI Namespace (T0/T1)

- [x] **1.1 hoocode-ai-stream** — Channel-backed `AssistantMessageEventStream` — **DONE** (async `EventStream` port since 7.3a)
- [x] **1.2 hoocode-ai-env** — API key detection from environment variables — **DONE**
- [x] **1.3 hoocode-ai-models** — Model registry + generated model lists — **DONE** ⚠ 907 of 1224 models, no `compat` → 8.1
- [x] **1.4 hoocode-ai-util** — JSON repair, validation, hash, header utilities — **DONE**
- [x] **1.5 hoocode-ai-provider-faux** — Test provider (port `faux.ts`) — **DONE**
- [x] **1.6 hoocode-ai-provider-anthropic** — Anthropic streaming provider — **DONE**
- [x] **1.7 hoocode-ai-provider-openai** — OpenAI Chat Completions provider — **DONE** (Responses/Codex APIs not yet ported) ⚠ Responses/Codex/compat routing → 8.2–8.4
- [x] **1.8 hoocode-ai-provider-google** — Google Gemini + Vertex providers — **DONE** (Vertex ADC/service-account auth deferred; API-key/access-token auth only)
- [x] **1.9 hoocode-ai-provider-azure** — Azure OpenAI Responses provider — **DONE** (reasoning-item ID pairing ported: streamed function calls carry their Responses item id encoded as `call_id|item_id` on `ToolCallContent::id`, reasoning items are stored verbatim in `ThinkingContent::signature`, and both are split/replayed on the next turn so Azure's `rs_...`/`fc_...` pairing validation passes; the cross-provider / different-model foreign-id remapping is not ported since the Rust `AssistantMessage` carries no originating provider/model)
- [x] **1.10 hoocode-ai-oauth** — OAuth flow support — **DONE** (Anthropic PKCE + GitHub Copilot device flow; interactive browser/callback-server wiring deferred to CLI layer)
- [x] **1.11 hoocode-ai-images** — Image generation support — **DONE** (OpenRouter provider)
- [x] **1.12 hoocode-ai umbrella publishable** — Flip all T0/T1 leaves to `publish = true` — **DONE** (all AI leaves already had `publish = true` from scaffolding; wired the umbrella's `lib.rs` to actually re-export every leaf)

### Phase 2 — TUI Namespace (T0)

- [x] **2.1 hoocode-tui-util** — ANSI width, grapheme handling, truncate/wrap — **DONE**
- [x] **2.2 hoocode-tui-fuzzy** — Fuzzy matching — **DONE**
- [x] **2.3 hoocode-tui-keys** — Key parsing + keybindings — **DONE** (global keybindings singleton not ported)
- [x] **2.4 hoocode-tui-terminal** — Terminal abstraction (raw mode, stdin buffer) — **DONE** (Windows `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` koffi tweak deferred)
- [x] **2.5 hoocode-tui-render** — Differential renderer — **DONE** (flatten memoization and 16ms render-coalescing are performance-only optimizations, not ported; differential terminal output is behaviorally equivalent)
- [x] **2.6 hoocode-tui-editing** — Text editor, kill ring, undo stack — **DONE** (`KillRing`, `UndoStack`; `editor-component.ts`'s trait is defined in 2.7 alongside `AutocompleteProvider`/`Editor`)
- [x] **2.7 hoocode-tui-components** — Box, text, markdown, select-list, autocomplete, etc. — **DONE**: Spacer, Text, TruncatedText, BoxComponent, Image, Loader, CancellableLoader, SelectList, SettingsList, Input, AutocompleteProvider, Markdown, Editor (109 tests). `Editor` is reduced-scope (see `crates/hoocode-tui-components/src/editor/editor.rs`): no paste-marker compression, no vim-style char-jump mode, no internal viewport scrolling.
- [x] **2.8 hoocode-tui-images** — Terminal image rendering — **DONE** (ported ahead of 2.5/2.6/2.7 since the renderer depends on it)
- [x] **2.9 hoocode-tui umbrella publishable** — All T0 leaves `publish = true` — **DONE** (all TUI leaves already had `publish = true` from scaffolding; wired the umbrella's `lib.rs` to re-export every leaf, matching the AI umbrella pattern). Phase 2 is now complete. ⚠ not wired into `hoocode` → Phase 11

### Phase 3 — Agent Namespace (T0/T1)

- [x] **3.1 hoocode-agent-core** — Agent struct, orchestration, state management — **DONE** (`Agent`, `build_loop_config`, orchestration)
- [x] **3.2 hoocode-agent-loop** — Turn loop, tool dispatch, background tools — **DONE** (loop moved from agent-core into standalone crate; sequential/parallel dispatch, background tasks, hooks) ⚠ 0 tests, no steering/follow-up → 7.5
- [x] **3.3 hoocode-agent-harness** — Message conversion, system prompt, prompt templates — **DONE** (message helpers, system-prompt builder, prompt templates)
- [x] **3.4 hoocode-agent-session** — Session persistence, file management — **DONE**; since 7.4 the port of `harness/session` (entry format, `buildSessionContext`, storage trait + memory/JSONL backends, `Session`, repos); the old `FileSessionStore` is gone
- [x] **3.5 hoocode-agent-compaction** — Context window compaction, summarization — **DONE** (token estimation, KeepRecentStrategy, SummaryStrategy) ⚠ 171 LOC vs 1.4K TS (no branch summarization) → 9.2
- [x] **3.6 hoocode-agent-tools** — Tool registry / factory pattern — **DONE** (ToolRegistry, factory helpers, result constructors)
- [x] **3.7 hoocode-agent-mcp** — MCP transport, tool discovery — **DONE** (stdio and HTTP/SSE transports, `mcp.json` loader, tool discovery, Streamable HTTP with SSE fallback; OAuth deferred) ⚠ replace transport with `rmcp`, add OAuth → 9.1
- [x] **3.8 hoocode-agent umbrella publishable** — T0/T1 leaves `publish = true` — **DONE** (umbrella re-exports all agent leaves; all T0/T1 leaves publish = true). Phase 3 T0/T1 is complete.

### Phase 4 — Code Namespace Core (T2)

- [x] **4.1 hoocode-code-config** — Settings load/merge/persist, config paths — **DONE** (JSON config, merge, default paths)
- [x] **4.2 hoocode-code-tools** — `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` — **DONE** (tool functions, schemas, default_tools factory, permission policy) ⚠ 0.4.x tool set, thin wrappers → 10.2
- [x] **4.3 hoocode-code-session** — Session CRUD, directory layout, lifecycle — **DONE** (JSONL session tree with append-only entries, branching, labels, compaction/context building, CRUD/list/fork) ⚠ JSON not hoocode-compatible, not wired → 7.2, 10.3
- [x] **4.4 hoocode-code-prompts** — System prompt assembly, mode prompts — **DONE** (Mode, system_prompt, initial_user_prompt, templates)
- [x] **4.5 hoocode-code-print** — Non-interactive print mode — **DONE** (text/JSON output formatting, `PrintFormatter`)
- [x] **4.6 hoocode-code-main** — CLI entry point (`hoocode` binary), arg parsing — **DONE** (`hoocode` binary, `Args`, `parse_args`, dispatch; runtime modes deferred) ⚠ hand-written args, subset of flags → 10.7

### Phase 5 — Code Namespace Full (T3)

- [x] **5.1 hoocode-code-rpc** — JSON-RPC mode — **DONE** (line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 server over stdin/stdout, lifecycle methods, tools/list, tools/call; wired to `hoocode --mode rpc`) ⚠ generic JSON-RPC 2.0, not hoocode's RPC protocol → 10.8
- [x] **5.2 hoocode-code-subagents** — Subagent pool, Task tool, IPC — **DONE** (`SubagentPool`, `SubagentHandle`, `task_tool`, concurrency permits, timeout, wired `hoocode --mode subagent`) ⚠ not wired into the tool set → 10.9
- [x] **5.3 hoocode-code-resources** — Resource loading, skills, context files — **DONE** (`Resource`, `Skill`, `load_resource`, `load_skills_dir`, `load_context_files`, `assemble_context`)
- [x] **5.4 hoocode-code-extensions** — WASM plugin API (design + initial implementation) — **DONE** (`Plugin`, `PluginRegistry`, `wasmtime` runtime, `alloc`/`dealloc`/`run` ABI, `log` host import) ⚠ prototype only → Phase 12
- [x] **5.5 Interactive mode** — TUI-based interactive mode wiring — **DONE** (crossterm-based raw-mode chat loop wired to `hoocode` default path; agent response placeholder until runtime integration) ⚠ readline loop, TUI crates unused → Phase 11
- [x] **5.6 hoocode-code umbrella publishable** — All leaves `publish = true` — **DONE** (umbrella re-exports all code leaves; all T0/T1 leaves already `publish = true`)

### Phase 6 — Integrate and Release

- [x] **6.1 hoocode top umbrella** — Re-export all namespace umbrellas — **DONE**
- [x] **6.2 Parity checklist** — Run hoocode and hoocode side-by-side on scripted scenarios — **DONE** (structured parity checklist in Section 11; scripted runtime validation deferred until CLI agent wiring is complete) ⚠ script only checks `--help` → Phase 13
- [x] **6.3 Binary distribution** — Cross-platform CI builds (4 targets) — **DONE** (`.github/workflows/binaries.yml` builds for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)
- [x] **6.4 First public release** — `cargo publish` train, GitHub Release with binaries — **READY** (all code changes complete, CI workflows in place, clippy clean, tests passing; trigger via `Release` workflow to publish and create release) ⚠ hold the code-namespace publish until Phase 10
- [x] **6.5 Documentation** — README, install guide, migration guide from hoocode — **DONE** (README updated with install/source instructions, usage modes, and migration status link)

### Phase 7 — Foundations reset (blocking; do first)

Everything later serializes these types or runs on this runtime, so this phase is ordered strictly.

- [x] **7.0 Pin + docs hygiene.** Record the pin in root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.metadata.hoocode.source]` (done with this revision). Fold the stale `MIGRATION_*.md` files into `CHANGELOG.md` or delete them, and point the README status at this document.
- [x] **7.1 MSRV 1.88.** Bump `rust-version`, set the CI toolchain, and add `rust-toolchain.toml` so contributors build the same way.
- [x] **7.2 Hoocode-compatible wire types.** In `ai-types` and `agent-types`:
  - Internally tagged `role` on messages and `type` on content blocks, all camelCase.
  - `UserMessage.content` accepts `string | blocks`.
  - `AssistantMessage` gains `api`, `provider`, `model`, `responseModel?`, `responseId?`, `diagnostics?`, a non-optional `usage` (with `cost`), and a non-optional `timestamp`.
  - `ToolResultMessage.details`.
  - Content blocks match TS field for field: `ToolCall` becomes `{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments, thoughtSignature?}`, `ThinkingContent` becomes `{thinking, thinkingSignature?, redacted?}`, `TextContent` becomes `{text, textSignature?}`, and `ImageContent` becomes `{data, mimeType}`. Rust's per-block `cache_control` moves out of the content model into request-building options, as in TS.
  - `AgentMessage` becomes a flat `#[serde(untagged)]`/`tag="role"` enum covering the custom roles (`bashExecution`, `custom`, `branchSummary`, `compactionSummary`) instead of `{inner:{Standard:…}}`.
  - `code-session::FileEntry` uses `rename_all_fields = "camelCase"`.
  - Acceptance: round-trip real JSONL files recorded with hoocode at the pin (`tests/fixtures/hoocode-0.5.89/sessions/*.jsonl`), including v1→v2→v3 migration.
- [x] **7.3 Async core.** Move providers to async `reqwest` plus one shared SSE decoder (`eventsource-stream`), and delete the four `sse.rs` copies. `AssistantMessageEventStream` becomes a `futures::Stream`. `AbortSignal` becomes `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken`. Drop the `blocking` feature everywhere. Keep a thin `block_on` helper for tests. *Split 2026-09-25:* 7.3a (ai-sse, EventStream, abort, the four providers), 7.3b (async agent loop/core and consumers), 7.3c (remaining `reqwest::blocking`, `cache_control` into request building).
- [x] **7.4 One session stack.** Keep `code-session` (the JSONL tree) as the implementation. Reduce `agent-session` to the storage trait hoocode has in `agent/src/harness/session/{repo,storage}` (memory + JSONL). Delete the duplicate `FileSessionStore`.
- [x] **7.5 Agent loop parity.** Port `agent.ts` and `agent-loop.ts` from the pin: steering and follow-up queues, `prepareNextTurn`, `transformContext`, `convertToLlm`, parallel/sequential tool execution, abort mid-stream and mid-tool, and the full event sequence (`agent_start … turn_end … agent_end`). Port `agent.test.ts`, `agent-loop.test.ts` and `prepare-next-turn-refresh.test.ts` onto the faux provider (these crates have 0 tests today).

### Phase 8 — AI namespace parity

- [x] **8.1 Model registry at the pin.** Regenerate `models.json` from `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` at the pin (1224 models) using `scripts/convert_models_to_json.py`, and record the pin in the file. Add the `compat` structs (`OpenAICompletionsCompat`, `OpenAIResponsesCompat`, `AnthropicMessagesCompat`, OpenRouter/Vercel routing). Regenerate `image-models` too.
- [x] **8.2 API registry.** Dispatch on `model.api` (8 APIs), not on the provider name, mirroring `api-registry.ts` and `register-builtins.ts`. That routes all 31 known providers (groq, xai, openrouter, deepseek, cerebras, zai, …) through `openai-completions` with compat, and removes the hard-coded match in `code-main::runtime`. Extend the `env-api-keys.ts` parity test to cover every provider.
- [x] **8.3 `openai-responses`.** Extract the Responses request/stream code already in `ai-provider-azure` into a shared module, then add the `openai-responses` API (reasoning replay, foreign tool-call ids, partial-JSON cleanup, image tool results).
- [x] **8.4 Subscription providers.** `openai-codex-responses` (+ ChatGPT OAuth, SSE and WebSocket transport), `github-copilot` routing (Anthropic and OpenAI backends), `google-gemini-cli` and `google-antigravity` (+ OAuth). Lower priority: behind the core, but needed by users who log in with subscriptions.
- [x] **8.5 Provider utilities.** Port with their tests: `transform-messages` (cross-provider handoff), `overflow`, `retry-delay`, `param-fallback`, `tool-constraints`, `simple-options`, the Anthropic tool-name normalization and eager-tool-input handling, cache retention, and `xhigh`. Adopt `jsonschema` for tool-argument validation (`validation.ts`).
- [x] **8.6 Port the provider test suite.** The 68 TS test files map to Rust unit and fixture tests. Tests that need live keys (`*-e2e.test.ts`) become `#[ignore]` integration tests gated on env vars.

### Phase 9 — Agent harness parity

- [ ] **9.1 MCP on `rmcp`.** Replace `agent-mcp/src/transport.rs` with `rmcp` clients (child-process stdio, streamable HTTP, legacy SSE). Add MCP OAuth (`mcp-oauth.ts`) via `rmcp`'s `auth` feature. Keep the `mcp.json` loader, tool naming (`mcp_<server>_<tool>`), deferred MCP loading (`mcp-deferred.ts`) and status reporting (`mcp-status.ts`). Port the `extensions/core/mcp-loader.ts` discovery order. *(Status 2026-10-01: deferred: 9.1.)*
- [x] **9.2 Compaction.** Port `harness/compaction/{compaction,branch-summarization,utils}.ts` (~1.4K LOC), the cut-point selection, and `agent-session-compaction.ts` (auto-compaction thresholds and overflow recovery).
- [x] **9.3 Harness utilities.** Port `harness/{skills,prompt-templates,messages,system-prompt}.ts` deltas since 0.4.x, plus `utils/{truncate,shell-output,output-compression}.ts` (tool output limits shared by bash and read).
- [x] **9.4 Agent harness.** Port `harness/agent-harness.ts`: the execution environment abstraction (`env/nodejs.ts` → std/tokio implementation).
- [ ] **9.5 Proxy stream.** Port `proxy.ts` (app-server proxy streaming) only if an RPC or web consumer needs it. Otherwise it goes to Phase 12. *(Not in the ledger: not needed so far.)*

### Phase 10 — Coding-agent core (headless parity)

Goal: `hoocode -p` and `hoocode --mode rpc` behave like `hoocode` at the pin with the same settings, sessions and tools.

- [x] **10.1 Settings.** Port `settings-{manager,types,defaults,storage}.ts`: global + project scopes, merge rules, file locking (`fs4`) and atomic writes (`tempfile`). Read `~/.hoocode/settings.json` and `.hoocode/settings.json` as fallback sources, and keep the `migrate.rs` one-shot copy.
- [ ] **10.2 Built-in tools at the pin.** Default bundle `read, bash, edit, write, SearchCodebase`. Opt-in via flags: `webfetch`, `websearch` (`--enable-webtools`), `todo` (`--enable-todowrite`), `subagent` (`--enable-subagents`). Keep `grep/find/ls` only as non-default compatibility tools. Per tool: *(Status 2026-10-01: L1 only (L2 waits on 12.4): 10.2a, 10.2b, 10.2c, 10.2d, 10.2f, 10.2g; deferred: 10.2e.)*
  - `read`: truncation, line ranges, image reads via `image`, and `read-dedup`.
  - `bash`: `process-wrap` process groups, timeout, abort, `output-accumulator`, and shell resolution (`utils/shell.ts`).
  - `edit`: `edit-diff.ts` fuzzy matching with `similar`, `file-mutation-queue`, and diff details for the UI.
  - `write`
  - `SearchCodebase`: lexical mode on `grep-searcher` + `ignore`. Semantic and hybrid modes go to Phase 12.
  - `webfetch`/`websearch`: `htmd` + `dom_smoothie`, and the `webtools-shared.ts` limits.
  - Port the tool tests.
- [x] **10.3 AgentSession.** Port `agent-session.ts` plus its `-runtime`, `-services`, `-retry`, `-stats`, `-skills` and `-tree-navigation` modules. This is the orchestrator all three modes share: persistence into the `code-session` tree, retries, auto-compaction, model and thinking switching, and cost/usage stats. `session-manager.ts` deltas and `session-cwd`/`session-identity` go here too.
- [ ] **10.4 Models and auth.** Port `model-registry.ts` (built-ins + user `models.json` custom providers), `model-resolver.ts` (`provider/model` patterns, `--models` scoping, fuzzy match), `auth-storage.ts` (`auth.json` format-compatible; OAuth refresh with a lock), and `auth-guidance.ts`. *(Status 2026-10-01: L1 only (L2 waits on 12.4): 10.4c.)*
- [ ] **10.5 Resources.** Port `resource-loader.ts`, `skills.ts`, `builtin-skills.ts`, `prompt-templates.ts`, `context-files.ts` (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md walk-up), `slash-commands.ts`, `mode-prompts.ts` and the ask/plan/build/debug mode system (`extensions/core/modes.ts`), plus `agent-frontmatter`/`agent-registry` (`--agent`). Parse frontmatter with `serde_yaml_ng`. Discovery honors `.hoocode/` and `.cortexcode/`. *(Status 2026-10-01: L1 only (L2 waits on 12.4): 10.5.)*
- [x] **10.6 Permission gate.** Port the `extensions/core/permission-gate.ts` policy (hard tool/command policy, `--disallowed-tools`, per-session approvals). Keep the trait from `agent-types`.
- [x] **10.7 CLI.** Move `code-main` args into `code-cli` as an exact port of the hand-written `args.ts` parser (not `clap`; see §3.4) with **exactly** the pinned flag set (`cli/args.ts`, 50+ flags incl. `--continue/--resume/--session/--fork/--no-session`, `--models`, `--thinking`, `--tools/--no-tools`, `--list-models`, `--export`, `--offline`, `--print-token-surface`). Also port `initial-message.ts`, `file-processor.ts` (`@file` args) and `list-models.ts`.
- [x] **10.8 Print and RPC protocol parity.** `--mode json` must emit the same event objects as `print-mode.ts`. Replace the generic JSON-RPC server with hoocode's RPC protocol (`modes/rpc/{rpc-types,rpc-mode,jsonl}.ts`: commands, events, extension UI requests). Port `rpc-client.ts` as a Rust client so subagents and tests can use it.
- [x] **10.9 Subagents.** Port `subagent-pool.ts`, `tools/subagent.ts`, `subagent-{depth,events,inbox,result}.ts`, `lifeguard.ts` (heartbeat/timeout) and `dispatch-evaluator.ts` (depth guard) on the 10.8 RPC protocol. The warm pool goes to Phase 12.
- [x] **10.10 Small core modules.** `bash-executor`, `exec`, `event-bus`, `git-branch`, `format-*`, `token-budget`, `timings`, `diagnostics`, `output-guard`/`output-verifier`, `resolve-config-value` (`!cmd` / env interpolation), `utils/{paths,git,mime,tls-ca}`. `--ca-cert`/`--use-system-ca` map to `reqwest` rustls roots.

### Phase 11 — Interactive TUI mode

- [x] **11.1 Wire the ported TUI.** Run `tui-render`, `tui-terminal` and `tui-keys` on a tokio task, fed by AgentSession events over channels. Replace `run_interactive_mode` and the ad-hoc `permission_dialog`. Port `core/keybindings.ts` (app keybindings on top of `tui-keys`) and `theme/theme.ts` with its JSON themes.
- [x] **11.2 Chat view.** Port `interactive-mode.ts` (4.6K) incrementally: user and assistant messages (markdown + `syntect` highlighting), tool execution and tool-chain summaries, the `diff` component (`similar`), bash execution, compaction and branch summaries, footer, loaders, and notifications.
- [x] **11.3 Selectors and dialogs.** Model, scoped-models, session (resume), tree, settings, thinking, theme, login/oauth, config, user-message and ask-options.
- [x] **11.4 Input features.** The slash-command executor (`command-executor.ts`), `@file` autocomplete (`tui-components` autocomplete + `ignore`), `!` bash, clipboard text and image paste (`arboard` + `image`), and image display (`tui-images`).
- [x] **11.5 Task panel.** `task-panel.ts`, `task-store.ts`, and subagent progress display.

### Phase 12 — Extended features (triage; each needs a go/no-go before starting)

| Item | hoocode source | Suggested approach |
|---|---|---|
| Declarative plugins and marketplace (skills, commands, MCP from `.agents-plugin`, claude and copilot formats) | `core/extensions/plugins/**`, `extensions/core/marketplace.ts` | Port. It is data only, so no code runtime is needed |
| Package manager (`hoocode install`, git/npm sources) | `core/package-manager.ts`, `package-manager-cli.ts` | Port the git/local sources. npm sources are optional |
| Code extensions (`ExtensionAPI`) | `core/extensions/{types,runner,loader}.ts` | Out-of-process protocol (reuse the 10.8 RPC). `wasmtime` stays experimental |
| Semantic index, hybrid search, capability retrieval | `core/embsearch`, `core/search`, `core/capabilities` | Spawn the same external `embsearch` binary. `bm25` crate for capabilities |
| Scheduler, `/loop`, Cron tools | `core/scheduler.ts`, `extensions/core/loop.ts` | `croner` |
| Warm subagent pool | `core/warm-subagent-pool*.ts` | After 10.9 |
| `/learn`, canvas, hooteams (`--team`), voice, export-html/share, telemetry, version check, context-gc, thinking escalation, self-docs | various | Decide case by case. Default is not ported |

### Phase 13 — Parity verification (runs alongside Phases 7–11)

- [x] **13.1 Fixture recorder.** *(Level-2 harness built: `migration/tui-parity/`; recording of session/json/rpc fixtures for 13.2 uses `harness.py run --keep`.)* A script that checks out hoocode at the pin, runs scripted scenarios with the **faux provider**, and records the session JSONL, `--mode json` event streams and RPC transcripts into `tests/fixtures/hoocode-0.5.89/`, stamped with the pin.
- [x] **13.2 Replay harness.** Rust integration tests drive `hoocode` with the same faux script and compare normalized output (ids, timestamps and paths masked) using `insta`. *(Done: `harness.py record` runs the terminal-free scenarios in `migration/tui-parity/replay.json` headless against hoocode into `crates/hoocode-code-main/tests/fixtures/hoocode-0.5.89/replay/` plus insta snapshots; `cargo test -p hoocode-code-main --test replay` replays them against `hoocode` with a Rust port of `mockllm.py`, comparing exit status, stdout/stderr, requests, session files and work files.)*
- [x] **13.3 Replace `scripts/parity_test.sh`.** Its `--help` grep checks become a smoke test only. CI runs 13.2. *(Done: the script checks `--version`/`--help`, runs the 13.2 replay test and, when the pinned hoocode is built, the L2 `print-basic` scenario. CI runs 13.2 in `cargo test --workspace`; the nightly L2 workflow is staged in `migration/ci/tui-parity.yml`.)*
- [ ] **13.4 TS test port ledger.** A table in this doc listing each of the 400 TS test files as ported, equivalent or not applicable, updated per PR. *(13.4a: the table is generated, not hand-kept: `migration/ts_tests.py generate` writes `migration/ts-tests.json` from the ledger's `ts_tests`, Rust citations and `migration/ts-tests-overrides.json`; `ts_tests.py status` summarizes it. 13.4b resolves the files still marked `review`.)* *(Status 2026-10-01: deferred: 13.4.)*

### Recommended execution order

`migration/ledger.json` holds the authoritative order, and `ledger.py next` picks the
first ready task. In summary:

1. **7.0–7.2**: docs hygiene, MSRV/lockfile/CI gates, hoocode-compatible wire types.
2. **Milestone M1 (first Level-2 green):** a thin vertical slice.
   - 10.4a (`models.json`), 8.2a (API dispatch), 10.7a (`code-cli`) and 10.8a (print mode)
     make `print-basic` pass.
   - 10.2a (`read`) and 10.4c (system prompt) make `print-tool-read` pass, including
     identical model requests.
3. **7.3–7.5**: the async core refactor, guarded by the M1 scenarios, then one session
   stack and agent-loop parity.
4. **Phase 10 remainder + 8.1/8.2 + 9.x**: headless parity (settings, tools,
   AgentSession, resources, modes, CLI, json/RPC, subagents, MCP).
5. **Phase 11**: interactive TUI. The `startup`, `chat-basic` and `tool-read`
   scenarios already exist.
6. **8.3–8.7**: remaining providers and OAuth, any time after 7.3.
7. **Phase 12**: only after a go/no-go from the user.

## 10. Edge Cases and Risk Mitigation

### 10.1 Async tool execution (background tools)

TypeScript runs long tools (bash, webfetch) as background tasks while the agent continues. Rust uses `tokio::spawn` with `oneshot` channels for results:

```rust
let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::oneshot::channel();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let result = tool.execute(request).await;
    let _ = tx.send(result);
});
// Store rx; collect when agent loop needs the result
```

### 10.2 Process management (bash tool)

- Use `tokio::process::Command` with `kill_on_drop(true)`.
- Process group management prevents orphan children on agent abort.
- Configurable timeout matches TypeScript's `bashTimeout` setting.

### 10.3 Permission gate (Yes/No/Always)

- **Interactive mode:** `ratatui` dialog widget. Agent awaits user input.
- **Print mode:** Auto-grant (same as `-p` flag).
- **RPC mode:** Part of JSON-RPC protocol.
- Persistent decisions stored in a `HashMap<ToolCallHash, Permission>` for the session.

### 10.4 Subagent pool (Task tool)

- Spawn child processes running `hoocode` binary with `--mode subagent`.
- Communicate via stdin/stdout JSON-RPC.
- Concurrency limits and timeout controls matching TypeScript's `subagent-pool.ts`.

### 10.5 File locking (settings, sessions)

- Use `fs2` crate for cross-process safety (file locks via `flock` / `LockFile`).
- Fall back to `tokio::sync::RwLock` for single-process scenarios.

### 10.6 Data migration (from hoocode)

- Read `~/.hoocode/settings.json` for backward compatibility during transition.
- Write to `~/.cortexcode/` going forward.
- Auto-migrate settings on first run.
- *Added 2026-09-24:* The following must also be readable without conversion, which is
  why the wire types in 7.2 must match hoocode:
  - `~/.hoocode/auth.json` (OAuth + API keys) and `~/.hoocode/models.json` (custom providers)
  - hoocode session JSONL files (v1–v3, with in-place migration as in `session-manager.ts`)
  - `~/.hoocode/sessions/`, where the session list and `--resume` should show hoocode sessions
  - project `.hoocode/{settings.json,modes,skills,prompts,commands,agents}` and user `~/.agents/`
  - Env overrides map as follows: `HOOCODE_CODING_AGENT_DIR` → `CORTEXCODE_CODING_AGENT_DIR`,
    and the same for `*_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` and `*_USER_AGENTS_DIR`. Both names are honored.

### 10.7 Plugin / extension system

Porting TypeScript's dynamic extension system (`jiti`-based) to Rust is the highest-risk item:

- **v1:** No plugin system — all built-in tools compiled into the binary.
- **v2:** WASM plugins via `wasmtime` runtime — portable, sandboxed, no ABI stability issues.
- **v3:** Full plugin SDK with the same capabilities as the TypeScript version.
