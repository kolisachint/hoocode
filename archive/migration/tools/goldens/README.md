# Golden generators

Scripts that capture hoocode's output from the pinned build (`target/hoocode-pin`,
built by `migration/tui-parity/setup_hoocode.sh`) into Rust test fixtures.

Run with `migration/tools/goldens/run.sh <script> <output>`: the script is copied into
`packages/coding-agent/dist/` (so its relative imports resolve), run under
`COLORTERM=truecolor FORCE_COLOR=3` (a TTY-like chalk level, as the real app has), and
removed again.

Markdown: `markdown.mjs` produces `markdown-gold.json` (token streams and renders for a
corpus), `markdown-fuzz.mjs` produces `markdown-fuzz-gold.json` (token streams for
pseudo-random documents), and `marked-rules.mjs` dumps marked's compiled rule sources
that `rules_gen.rs` embeds. All three are in `crates/hoocode-tui-components/`.

Highlighting: `hljs-grammars.mjs` dumps highlight.js 10.7.3's languages (as cli-highlight
loads them) to `crates/hoocode-tui-highlight/data/hljs-grammars.json`, which the crate
embeds; `highlight.mjs` produces `crates/hoocode-tui-highlight/tests/fixtures/highlight-gold.json`
(cli-highlight's output over source files of the pin and of hoocode, snippets, and a
polyglot snippet in every language).
